# AmfSocket

AMF Socket is a bi-directional RPC system for Adobe Flash (Actionscript) programs.
This library is an implementation of [AMF Socket](https://github.com/chadrem/amf_socket) for Ruby's EventMachine.
This library and the corresponding Actionscript project aim to make high quality (and free) RPC accessible to all of the Flash platforms (web, mobile, and desktop).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'amf_socket'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install amf_socket

## Usage

Currently this library is immature and the API is evolving.
